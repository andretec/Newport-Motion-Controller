An axis assigned to a group cannot be moved individually using commands such as PA and PR.
Use group linear move commands instead.
Refer to the description of this command in the commands section
(See Section 3: Remote Mode) for correct syntax, parameter ranges.

HC move group along an arc -> pag 104

If this command is received while a group move is in progress, the new command
gets enqueued into a “via point” buffer. Please refer Advanced Capabilities
section for a detailed description of via point buffer implementation. The
enqueued commands get executed on a FIFO basis when the move already in
progress has reached its destination. The group does not come to a stop at the
end of last move. Instead, there will be a smooth transition to the new move
command, just as if it were one compound move (combination of multiple
moves).

In order to store the multiple move segment commands needed to
make a contour, we make use of a "via point" buffer. This "via point"
buffer contains group move commands essential to make a new move
segment upon completion of the move segment currently in progress.
The new move commands are pulled out of the buffer on a FIFO
basis. The "via point" buffer can hold a maximum of 10 group move
commands. If more than 10 group move commands are issued by a
user, the excess commands are flow-controlled by the firmware.
